    "**Remove Stop Words (or/and Frequent words/ Rare words)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop words are the most common words in any languages (like articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, etc) and does not add much information to the text. Examples of a few stop words in English are 'the', 'a', 'an', 'so', 'what'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can go wrong too.\n",
    "- Mark reported to the CEO: Mark reported CEO\n",
    "- Suzanne rpoerted as the CEO to the board: Suzanned reported CEO board\n",
    "\n",
    "In your NLP pipeline, you might create 4-grams such as reported to the CEO and reported as the CEO. If you removed the stop words from the 4-grams, both examples would be reduced to 'reported CEO', and you would lack the information about the professional hierarchy. In the first example, Mark could have been an assistant to the CEO, whereas in the second example Suzanne was the CEO reporting to the board. Unfortunately, retaining the stop words within your pipeline creates another problem: it increases the length of the n-grams required ot make use of these connections formed by the otherwise meaningless stop words. This issue forces us to retain at least 4-grams if you want to avoid ambiguity of the human resources example. designing a filter for stop words depends on your particular application.\n",
